This repository demonstrates a common error in Rust involving the unsafe use of raw pointers with vectors. The `bug.rs` file showcases the problematic code, while `bugSolution.rs` provides a safe and correct solution.  The error arises from violating Rust's ownership rules, leading to potential memory corruption or crashes. The solution emphasizes using safe Rust methods for vector manipulation.
